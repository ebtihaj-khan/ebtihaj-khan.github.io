I'm a data-driven Product Manager with 8+ years of experience, passionate about developing solutions that solve real-life problems through technology. From citizen-centric tech to tackling pressing health issues, I've shipped over 30 digital products across public, private, and nonprofit sectors.

Currently, I'm tackling a critical challenge in the global health sector with a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-backed project. I'm spearheading the development of a data-driven GIS-based product that has the potential to impact millions of lives.

What sets me apart?

1. Passion for impact: I don't just build products, I build products that matter. My social conscience fuels my drive to create solutions that address real-world challenges.
2. Data-driven decision-making: Numbers are my friends! I leverage data analysis to inform every step of the product development process, ensuring we build what users truly need.
3. Collaborative leadership: I believe in the power of cross-functional teams. I bring everyone to the table, fostering a culture of open communication and shared ownership.

More than products, I build solutions that empower people and leave a lasting impact. Connect with me to chat about innovation, data, and harnessing technology for good!
