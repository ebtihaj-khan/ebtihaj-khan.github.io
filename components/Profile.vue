      I am a technologist with over 20 years of professional experience designing and developing computing experiences
      spanning the public and private sectors. My diverse experience enables me to provide practical guidance and advice
      across programs and for engineering matters.

    <p class="mb-4">
      Much of my passion for civic tech stems from my love of technology, which began early. Growing up at the advent of
      personal computers and during the age of the internet provided me with every opportunity to explore, learn, and
      grow as a programmer and designer. I used this experience to build websites and computer animations for customers
      at a relatively young age.

      Having worked on large-scale projects over the course of my career, I have both the technical knowledge and the
      confidence to tackle ambitious ventures. I have helped build the first computerized identity cards,
      machine-readable passports, and driving licenses in Pakistan. My work also involved building border-control
      systems, online payment systems, vehicle tracking systems, and more at the National Database and Registration
      Authority.

      Following a study break in Malaysia, where I helped set up a virtual university, I worked on several projects as a
      consultant for the UN and other multilateral donor agencies. I conducted a census of the Afghan refugees in
      Pakistan and evaluated several international aid programs. As the resident technologist, I gained first-hand
      experience in data management and analysis from some of the leading experts in the field.

      I have developed innovative customer experience and engagement products for local telecommunication companies and
      government departments. Utilizing my knowledge in data analysis and user experience design, I have guided teams on
      improving multiple customer engagement products and processes.

      I moonlight as Director of Engineering at AlphaX Decision Sciences, a US-based startup developing AI-assisted
      decision support systems for companies in the oil and energy sector. I have a background in Computing and Visual
      Effects for Film from schools in Pakistan and Malaysia. I live in Islamabad, Pakistan.
