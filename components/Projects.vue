      "Developed a comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing polio vaccination coverage across Pakistan.",
      "Implemented real-time tracking of vaccination teams and supervisors to ensure efficient operations.",
      "Created a tool for identifying areas with low vaccination rates and potential coverage gaps.",
      "Designed a platform for monitoring vaccination compliance and SOP adherence."

    "description": "In this project, I led the product development of an ML-based model designed to identify Team Support Centers (TSCs)â€”the physical locations where polio vaccinators begin and end their day. The goal was to use data more intelligently to understand field team movements, workloads, and overall performance.",
    "bullets": [
      "ML model to detect ingress and egress movement patterns of vaccinators.",
